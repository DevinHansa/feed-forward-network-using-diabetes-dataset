# Feed-Forward Neural Network for Diabetes Prediction

This project implements a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "diabetes.csv". It contains the following columns:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes)

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
